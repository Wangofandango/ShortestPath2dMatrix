# ShortestPath2dMatrix
I need help solving a programming assignment :(

I got the assignment to make the method "shortestPath" that takes a matrix, and returns the length from start to finish

The Starting point will always be [1] [1]
and the Destinaton will always be [height-2] [width -2]
if there is no path it has to return Integer.MAX-VALUE.

The "maze test class" is what i run to test if my "maze" "shortestPath" method works. 

I feel like i am close to solving it, but i am missing a bit. :(

I am not sure as to how to keep track of what the "current" length is, or how i make it breadth first, and not depth first. To make it fast enough to get extra points :D

please help :( if u need more information feel free to comment
